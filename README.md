# Dscription
This is a Java program for a basic login page GUI (Graphical User Interface). Here's a short description:

The LoginPage class implements WindowAdapter and ActionListener. It sets up a simple login window with fields for a user ID and password, along with buttons for logging in and resetting the fields.

Key elements of the login page:

Frame: Represents the main window of the application.
Labels: Display text instructions for the user.
TextFields: Input fields for the user ID and password.
Buttons: "Login" and "Reset" buttons for submitting the login information or clearing the fields.
ActionListeners: Handles actions when buttons are clicked.
WindowListener: Closes the window when the user tries to close it.
The actionPerformed method defines the actions to be taken when buttons are clicked. If the reset button is clicked, it clears the text fields. If the login button is clicked, it checks the entered credentials. If they match the predefined values, it opens a welcome page. If not, it displays an error message.
